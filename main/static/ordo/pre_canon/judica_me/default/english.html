<h2>Psalm 42:1-5</h2>
<p><span class="red">S.</span> Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy: deliver me from
the unjust and deceitful man.
<br><span class="red">M.</span> For Thou, O God, art my strength: why hast Thou cast me off? and why do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflictech me?
<br><span class="red">S.</span> Send forth Thy light and Thy truth: they have led me and brought me unto Thy holy hill, and into Thy tabernacles.
<br><span class="red">M.</span> And I will go in unto the Altar of God: unto God, Who giveth joy to my youth.
<br><span class="red">S.</span> I will praise Thee upon the harp, O God, my God: why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?
<br><span class="red">M.</span> Hope thou in God, for I will yet praise Him: Who is the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
<br><span class="red">S.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
<br><span class="red">M.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
<br><span class="red">Ant.</span> I will go in unto the Altar of God. Unto God, Who giveth joy to my youth.
<br><span class="red">℣.</span> Our help ✠ is in the Name of the Lord.
<br><span class="red">℟.</span> Who hath made heaven and earth.</p>
