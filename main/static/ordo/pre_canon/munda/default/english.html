<p> Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias
with a burning coal, and vouchsafe, through Thy gracious mercy, so to purify me, that I may worthily
announce Thy holy Gospel. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
<br> Give me Thy blessing, O Lord. The Lord be in my heart and on my lips, that I may worthily and in a becoming manner, proclaim His holy Gospel. Amen.
