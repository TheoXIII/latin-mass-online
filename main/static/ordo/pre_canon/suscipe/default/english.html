<p>Accept, O holy Father, almighty and eternal God, this unspotted host, which I, Thy unworthy servant,
offer unto Thee, my living and true God, for my innumerable sins, offenses, and negligences, and for
all here present: as also for all faithful Christians, both living and dead, that it may avail both
me and them for salvation unto life everlasting. Amen.</p> 
<p><br>O God, who, in creating human nature, didst wonderfully dignify it, and still more wonderfully
restore it, grant that, by the Mystery of this water and wine, we may be made partakers of His
divine nature, who vouchsafed to be made partaker of our human nature, even Jesus Christ our Lord,
Thy Son, who with Thee, liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God: world without end.
Amen.</p>
<p> We offer unto Thee, O Lord, the chalice of salvation, beseeching Thy clemency, that it may
ascend before Thy divine Majesty, as a sweet savor, for our salvation, and for that of the whole
world. Amen.</p>
<p>Accept us, O Lord, in the spirit of humility and contrition of heart, and grant that the
sacrifice which we offer this day in Thy sight may be pleasing to Thee, O Lord God.</p>
<p>Come, O almighty and eternal God, the Sanctifier, and bless âœ  this Sacrifice, prepared for the
glory of Thy holy Name.</p>
