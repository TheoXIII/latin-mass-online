<p> I will wash my hands among the innocent: and I will compass Thine altar, O Lord That I may hear
the voice of praise: and tell of all Thy wonderous works. I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of Thy
house and the place where Thy glory dwelleth. Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: nor my
life with blood-thirsty men. In whose hands are iniquities, their right hand is filled with gifts.
But I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have mercy on me. My foot hath stood in the direct
way, in the churches I will bless Thee, O Lord.</p>
<p><span class="red">℣.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.
<br><span class="red">℟.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<p>
<p>Receive, O holy Trinity, this oblation which we make to Thee, in memory of the Passion,
Resurrection and Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in honor of Blessed Mary, ever Virgin,
blessed John the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and of all the Saints, that it may avail
unto their honor and our salvation, and may they vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven, whose
memory we celebrate on earth. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p><br><span class="red">S.</span> Brethren, pray that my Sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father almighty.
<br><span class="red">M.</span> May the Lord receive the Sacrifice from thy hands, to the praise and glory of His Name, to our benefit and that of all His holy Church.
<br><span class="red">S.</span> Amen.</p>
