<h2>Communion of the People</h2>
<p><i>The priest presents the Host:</i></p>
<p>Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him Who taketh away the sins of the world.
</p>
<p><i>The people respond, striking their breast:</i></p>
<p><br><span class="red">℟.</span> Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my soul shall be healed.
<br><span class="red">℟.</span> Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my soul shall be healed.
<br><span class="red">℟.</span> Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my soul
shall be healed.</p>
<p><i>When distributing communion, the priest whispers the following to each communicant, as he  makes a Sign of the Cross with the Host:</i></p>
<p>May the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul unto life everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p><i>After Communion the priest puts any extra Hosts into the Tabernacle. Then, taking the Chalice,
  has a server pour in wine to rinse away any remnants of the Precious Blood. He drinks it and says
  quietly:</i></p>
<p>Grant, O Lord, that what we have taken with our mouth, we may receive with a pure mind; and that
from a temporal gift it may become for us an everlasting remedy.<p>
<p>May Thy Body, O Lord, which I have received and Thy Blood which I have drunk, cleave to my inmost
parts, and grant that no stain of sin remain in me; whom these pure and holy Sacraments have
refreshed. Who livest and reignest world without end. Amen.</p>
