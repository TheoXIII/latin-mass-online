<h2>Communion of the Priest</h2>
<p> I will take the Bread of heaven, and will call upon the Name of the Lord.

<p><i>The Priest makes the Sign of the Cross with the Host over the paten, saying silently:</i></p>
<p>The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul unto life everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p><i>After consuming the Host:</i></p>
<p>What return shall I make to the Lord for all He has given to me? I will take the chalice of
salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord. Praising I will call upon the Lord, and I shall be
saved from my enemies.</p>
<p><i>He makes the Sign of the Cross over the Chalice, saying:</i></p>
<p>The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul unto life everlasting. Amen.</p>
