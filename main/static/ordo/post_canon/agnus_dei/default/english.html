<p> Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.
<br>Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.
<br>Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, grant us peace.</p>

<p><i>The following is said silently, and omitted in masses for the dead</i></p>

<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, who saidst to Thine Apostles: Peace I leave you, My peace I give you: regard
not my sins, but the faith of Thy Church; and vouchsafe to grant her that peace and unity which is
agreeable to Thy will: Who livest and reignest God, world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, Who, by the will of the Father and the co-operation of
the Holy Ghost, hast by Thy death given life to the world: deliver me by this, Thy most sacred Body
and Blood, from all my iniquities and from every evil; make me cling always to Thy commandments, and
permit me never to be separated from Thee. Who with the same God, the Father and the Holy Ghost,
livest and reignest God, world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Let not the partaking of Thy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ, which I, though unworthy, presume to
receive, turn to my judgment and condemnation; but through Thy mercy may it be unto me a safeguard
and a healing remedy both of soul and body. Who livest and reignest with God the Father, in the
unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end. Amen.</p>
