<p>May the tribute of my homage be pleasing to Thee, O most holy Trinity. Grant that the Sacrifice
which I, unworthy as I am, have offered in the presence of Thy Majesty, may be acceptable to Thee.
Through Thy mercy may it bring forgiveness to me and to all for whom I have offered it. Through
Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
