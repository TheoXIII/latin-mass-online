<h2>Our Father</h2>
<p>Let us pray. Instructed by Thy saving precepts, and following Thy divine institution, we are bold to say:
</p><p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
<br><span class="red">M.</span> But deliver us from evil.
<br><span class="red">S.</span> Amen.</p>

<p>Deliver us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, from all evils, past, present, and to come; and by the
intercession of the Blessed and glorious ever Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and of the holy Apostles,
Peter and Paul, and of Andrew, and of all the Saints, mercifully grant peace in our days, that
through the assistance of Thy mercy we may be always free from sin, and secure from all
disturbance.</p>

<p>Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord.
<br>Who with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth God,
<br><span class="red">S.</span> World without end.
<br><span class="red">M.</span> Amen.
<br><span class="red">S.</span> The peace ✠ of the Lord be ✠ always with ✠ you.
<br><span class="red">M.</span> And with thy spirit.</p>
