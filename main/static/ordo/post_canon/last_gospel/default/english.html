<h2>The Last Gospel</h2>
<p><span class="red">℣.</span> The Lord be with you.
<br><span class="red">℟.</span> And with thy spirit.
The beginning + of the holy Gospel according to Saint John.
<br><span class="red">℟.</span> Glory be to Thee, O Lord.</p>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was made nothing that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men: and the Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through Him might believe. He was not the Light, but was to bear witness of the Light.
That was the true Light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world. He was in the
world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own
received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them He gave power to become the sons of God; to
them that believe in His name: who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God.</p>
<p><i>All kneel</i></p>
<p><b>AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH</b></p>
<p>and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full
of grace and truth.
<br><span class="red">℟.</span> Thanks be to God.</p>
