<p>Who, the day before He suffered, took bread into His holy and venerable hands, and with His eyes
lifted up towards heaven unto Thee, God, His almighty Father, giving thanks to Thee, He blessed âœ 
it, broke it and gave it to His disciples saying: Take and eat ye all of this,</p>
<p><b>FOR THIS IS MY BODY.</b></p>
