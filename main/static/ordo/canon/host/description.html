<p>The priest repeats the words of the Lord at the Last Supper. When the words "took bread" are
spoken, he takes the host into his hands and makes the sign of the cross as he says "blessed it". He
then bends over the Host and, standing <i>in persona Christi</i> (in the person of Christ),
consecrates the Host. It now becomes the Body of Christ. He then elevates the Sacred Host, and the
bell is rung three times.</p>
