<p>We therefore, humbly pray and beseech Thee, most merciful Father, through Jesus Christ; Thy Son,
our Lord, that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to accept and bless these ✠ gifts, these ✠ presents, these ✠
holy unspotted Sacrifices, which in the first place we offer Thee for Thy holy Catholic Church to
which vouchsafe to grant peace, as also to preserve, unite, and govern it throughout the world,
together with Thy servant our Pope, and our Bishop, and all orthodox believers and professors of the
Catholic and Apostolic Faith.</p>
