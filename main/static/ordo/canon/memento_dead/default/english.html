<p>Remember also, O Lord, Thy servants and handmaids N. and N., who are gone before us with the sign
of faith, and rest in the sleep of peace. To these, O Lord, and to all that rest in Christ, grant,
we beseech Thee, a place of refreshment, light, and peace; Through the same Christ our Lord.
Amen.</p>
