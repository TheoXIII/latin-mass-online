<p>Wherefore, O Lord, we Thy servants, as also Thy holy people, calling to mind the blessed Passion
of the same Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, and also His Resurrection from the dead and His glorious
Ascension into heaven: do offer unto Thy most excellent Majesty of Thine own gifts, bestowed upon
us, a pure ✠ Host, a holy ✠ Host, an unspotted ✠ Host, the holy ✠ Bread of eternal life, and the
Chalice ✠ of everlasting salvation.</p>
<p>Upon which vouchsafe to look with a propitious and serene countenance, and to accept them, as
Thou wert graciously pleased to accept the gifts of Thy just servant Abel, and the sacrifice of our
patriarch Abraham, and that which Thy high priest Melchisedech offered to Thee, a holy Sacrifice,
and unspotted Victim.</p>
<p>We most humbly beseech Thee, almighty God, command these offerings to be borne by the hands of
Thy holy Angels to Thine altar on high, in the sight of Thy divine majesty, that as many as shall
partake of the most holy Body ✠ and Blood ✠ of Thy Son at this altar, may be filled with every
heavenly grace and blessing. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
