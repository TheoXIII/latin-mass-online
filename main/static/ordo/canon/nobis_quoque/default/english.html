<p>To us also, Thy sinful servants, confiding in the multitude of Thy mercies, vouchsafe to grant
some part and fellowship with Thy holy Apostles and Martyrs, with John, Stephen, Matthias, Barnabas,
Ignatius, Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicitas, Perpetua, Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia,
Anastasia, and with all Thy Saints, into whose company we beseech Thee to admit us, not weighing our
merits, but pardoning our offenses. Through Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>By Whom, O Lord, Thou dost ever create. sanctify, ✠ quicken, ✠ bless, ✠ and give unto us all these good things.
<br>By Him, ✠ and with Him, ✠ and in Him ✠ is to Thee, God the Father ✠ almighty, in the unity of the Holy ✠ Ghost, all honor and glory.
