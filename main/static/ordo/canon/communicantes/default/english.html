and of the blessed Apostles and Martyrs Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, John, Thomas, James, Philip,
Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon, and Thaddeus; Linus, Cletus, Clement, Xystus, Cornelius, Cyprian,
Lawrence, Chrysogonus, John and Paul, Cosmas and Damian, and of all Thy Saints, through whose merits
and prayers, grant that we may in all things be defended by the help of Thy protection. Through the
same Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
