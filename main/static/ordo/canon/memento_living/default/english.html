<p>Be mindful, O Lord, of Thy servants and handmaidens, N. et N. and of all here present, whose
faith and devotion are known unto Thee, for whom we offer, or who offer up to Thee, this sacrifice
of praise for themselves, their families and friends, for the redemption of their souls, for the
health and salvation they hope for; and who now pay their vows to Thee, the everlasting, living and
true God.</p>
